# compiler_design

In this we are learing about compilers how complier complies the code and turn it into machine language.
There are 6 stages for designing a compiler:
   1) Lexcial analysis
   2) Syntax analysis
   3) Sementic analysis
   4) Generating intermidiate code
   5) Code optiminzation
   6) Target code generation
   
We are learning about lexcial analysis now

I hope we can create our own compiler by end of course :)
